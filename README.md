JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

For this challenge I took the provided starter code and built a JavaScript application that would prompt the user for a series of password criteria and then generate a random password based on those criteria. The newly generated password was then displayed in the page's textbox.

## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
So that I can create a strong password that provides greater security


## Acceptance Criteria
When the user click on the Generate Password button.
Then user will be presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria.

* Size of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
* Do they want lowercase letters
* Do they want uppercase letters
* Do they want numeric characters
* Do they want special characters

The user's input is validated to ensure the size is within range and that at least one character set has been selected.

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
